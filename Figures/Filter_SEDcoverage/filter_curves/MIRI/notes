Note from Alistair Glasse (MIRI Instrument Scientist)::

You will find the MRS transmission files in the CDP7 delivery.  I then
strongly recommend that you use these MRS PCE files
(MIRI_FM_MIRIFULONG_3LONG_PCE etc.) for the MRS throughput modelling;
the files at Arizona are not supported, reviewed or properly
maintained.


Note to NPR::
When the CDP7 file (ETC_Ref_Files_CDP7.zip) is unzipped, it's the
     MIRI_FM_MIR*
files that you are interested in.
