JIST is intended for initial exploration and quick feasibility
checks. For detailed results, please use the JWST ETC.




Usage Notes::
==========================================================================

JIST Handles saturation by setting SNR to zero for saturated
points. This is a simplified assumption. JIST is not recommended for
working with saturated data.

For NIRCam and NIRISS Wide-Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) modes,
R-grism and C-grism values should have identical SNR. As such, JIST
presents only the R Grism values.

All calculations are based on a single point source with:
    Flat SED
    Background spectrum set to 120% of the minimum zodiacal background, with:
    	       Assumed date June 19, 2019
	       RA,DEC = 17h26m44s,-73Â°19m56s


JIST uses a single integration in almost all modes. For multiple
integrations or dithers, the SNR may be scaled by SQRT(number of
dithered exposures). For MIRI MRS and NIRSpec IFU exposures, assume
two integrations corresponding to a two-point nod.




CONVERSIONS::
