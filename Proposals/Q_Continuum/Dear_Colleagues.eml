Dear Colleagues, 

I hope this email finds you well. 
This is a very exploratory note to let you know what I’ve been thinking as regards JWST Cycle 1 and the quasars. 
I’m emailing since I’m assuming there is general interest and potential research overlap here. 
The Cycle 1 GO proposal deadline is 01 May 2020, nine weeks from today. 

 
So, the General Plan would be:: 
        to obtain MIRI imaging. coronagraphy and spectroscopy of all known z>6.70 quasars. 

MIRI spectroscopy covers 4.9um-28.8um (MIRI imaging is 5.6um to 25.5um) giving you 
coverage of the optical/near-IR 0.65 - 3.6um rest-frame at z=6.70.

As a further guide, the Universe is: 
850, 816 and 800 Myrs old at z=6.50, z=6.70 and z=6.80, respectively, 
for a flat, H0= 69.6, OmegaM = 0.286, OmegaLambda = 0.714 cosmology. 

The Science Case would include: 
        - How did the first SMBHs form?
        - What are the BH masses from multiple lines (including rest-frame Balmer)? 
        - What are the host galaxy properties of z>6.7 quasars? (noting already obtained ALMA data) 
        - What is the stellar content of the quasars host galaxy? Does the Magorrian relation hold at very high-z? 
        - Is there evidence for (major) merging?
        - What is the environment of the z>6.7 quasars (MIRI imaging FoV is ~0.4 Mpc x 0.6 Mpc on a side at z=7.00)
        - Whats the optical/near-IR spectral slope for the highest redshift quasars?
        - Are the z>6.7 luminous quasars different from ‘regular AGN’ detected in the JWST Deep Fields?


Building on Ross & Cross (2020, MNRAS accepted) and from Sarah Bosman’s current list: 
        http://www.sarahbosman.co.uk/list_of_all_quasars.htm
there are 29 (20) objects with z>6.70 (6.80). 

I immediately note that you could sculpt the target list and sample to include fewer objects, 
e.g. potentially those with just *the* most massive BHs, but I think a ‘large sample’ and ambition 
is good here. 

If one then takes the Ferruit et al. GTO #1219 proposal as a baseline:
        http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/observing-programs/program-information?id=1219
then the MIRI observations are 4.90 hours charged per object. 
This comprises of 4.28hrs for MRS spectroscopy and 0.62hours for MIRI F560W imaging. 
So 29 (20) * 4.90hrs = 142.1 (98.0) hours in total. 
As a guide, Large programs in Cycle 1 are >75 hours. 

However, the MIRI coronagraphic imaging is a unique JWST capability, so I would strongly suspect 
you’d like to use this too. However, I don’t have a great feel yet for the trade-offs of the Lyot-type vs. 
three 4-quadrant phase-mask (4QPM) coronagraphs.

Replicating the full Ferruit et al. GTO #1219 proposal, which includes NIRSpec MSA and IFU 
observations as well, is 18.71hrs per object, pushing you to > ~400 hrs (!!) 


Some other key things to note::  

The GTO teams are already looking at several of the z>6.70 quasars. 
However, from what I can tell (see attached JWST_GTO_VHzQ.notes) only 
the z=7.54 J134208.10+092838.61 quasar is currently being observed by MIRI. 

Pretty obviously(!!) I would strongly suspect other teams will be looking at the 
very high-redshifts quasars. However, a *key point* here is not to directly compete 
with those observations, but moreover, complement them. As such, I’m very keen 
to do this all ‘out in the open’, and to this extent, I’m putting up a lot of my notes 
on GitHub::
        https://github.com/d80b2t/JWST_Cycle1

The GTO and ERS programs already have the targets and instruments and modes 
that they are going to be using. One could then start to build-up on that arguing that 
you’ll never have the lambda >5um space-based data again any time again soon, 
and generating this sample of a decent number (all?!) of the z>6.7 quasars is exactly 
what JWST was built for, and this will have tremendously legacy for a long time. 

This could/would be suggested as a multi-cycle program (though not necessarily explicitly 
as that I don’t think this category is implemented yet). Using the Cycle 1+GTO+(ERS?) 
data as type of Pilot program, observing maybe ~5-10 objects in total first, and letting 
that guide observations in future cycles. 

Okay, great. Just wanted to circulate to at least get some level of discussion going. 

Best,  
Nic
