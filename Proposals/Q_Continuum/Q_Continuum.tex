Actively accreting supermassive black holes, i.e. quasars, are known to exist at very high redshift, when the Universe was
much less than a billion years old. 
However, we currently do not know how these first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) formed.
From estimates of the black hole mass, it is seen that SMBHs with $>10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ exist less than a billion years after the Big Bang.
%(usually based on quasar luminosity and the FWHM of the \mgii Mg ii line, under the assumption that local scaling relations are still valid at high luminosity and high redshift.) 
Current models (e.g. Thispaper (2012); Thispaper (2012), Thispaper (2012)) suggestion either
direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) or Population {\sc III} stars could be the progenitors of the very-high redshift SMBHs. 

% So, the General Plan would be::
{\it We propose to obtain MIRI imaging, coronagraphy and spectroscopy of all known $z \geq 6.8$ quasars.} 
%%
%MIRI covers 4.9$\mu$-28.8$\mu$m thus granting access to the optical/near-IR  0.65-3.6$\mu$m rest-frame at $z=6.70$.
MIRI covers 4.9-28.8$\mu$m thus granting access to the optical/near-IR  0.63-3.7$\mu$m rest-frame at $z=6.8$.
%MIRI covers 4.9$\mu$-28.8$\mu$m thus granting access to the optical/near-IR  0.61.-3.6$\mu$m rest-frame at $z=7.00$.
%MIRI covers 4.9$\mu$-28.8$\mu$m thus granting access to the optical/near-IR  0.57-3.37$\mu$m rest-frame at $z=7.54$.
%MIRI covers 4.9$\mu$-28.8$\mu$m thus granting access to the optical/near-IR  0.54-3.2$\mu$m rest-frame at $z=8.00$.
%MIRI covers 4.9$\mu$-28.8$\mu$m thus granting access to the optical/near-IR  0.49-2.88$\mu$m rest-frame at $z=9.00$.
%MIRI covers 4.9$\mu$-28.8$\mu$m thus granting access to the optical/near-IR  0.44-2.62$\mu$m rest-frame at $z=10.00$.

%As a further guide, the Universe is:  850, 816 and 800 Myrs old at z=6.50, z=6.70 and z=6.80, respectively,  for a flat, H0= 69.6, OmegaM = 0.286, OmegaLambda = 0.714 cosmology.

\noindent
The Science Case includes: \\
$\bullet$ How did the first SMBHs form? \\
$\bullet$ What are the BH masses from multiple lines (including rest-frame Balmer)? \\
$\bullet$ What are the host galaxy properties of $z>6.8$ quasars?  \\ %(noting already obtained ALMA data) 
$\bullet$ What is the stellar content of the quasars host galaxy? Does the Magorrian relation hold at very high-$z$? \\
$\bullet$ Is there evidence for (major) merging? \\
$\bullet$ What is the environment of the $z>6.8$ quasars?  \\   %(MIRI imaging FoV is ~0.4 Mpc x 0.6 Mpc on a side at z=7.00)
$\bullet$ Whats the optical/near-IR spectral slope for the highest redshift quasars? \\
$\bullet$ Are the $z>6.8$ luminous quasars different from `regular AGN' detected in  the JWST Deep Fields? \\
$\bullet$ What are the details of the Reionization Epoch? \\



These questions directly address two of the four {\it JWST} science themes
(The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization; %- JWST will be a powerful time machine with infrared vision that will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies forming out of the darkness of the early universe.
and Assembly of Galaxies) % JWST's unprecedented infrared sensitivity will help astronomers to compare the faintest, earliest galaxies to today's grand spirals and ellipticals, helping us to understand how galaxies assemble over billions of years.
%
No telescope or observatory in the midterm future will be able to access wavelengths longer than
5$\mu$m to these sensitivies. 

Building on the very high redshift quasar catalog in the infrared from
Ross \& Cross (2020, MNRAS accepted) and from Dr. Sarah Bosman’s current list: 
%        http://www.sarahbosman.co.uk/list_of_all_quasars.htm
there are 20 objects with $z \geq 6.80$. 

%If one then takes the Ferruit et al. GTO #1219 proposal as a baseline:
 %       http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/observing-programs/program-information?id=1219
%then the MIRI observations are 4.90 hours charged per object. 
%This comprises of 4.28hrs for MRS spectroscopy and 0.62hours for MIRI F560W imaging. 
%So 29 (20) * 4.90hrs = 142.1 (98.0) hours in total. 
%As a guide, Large programs in Cycle 1 are >75 hours. 

MIRI coronagraphy is a capability unique to JWST.
% so I would strongly suspect  you’d like to use this too. However, I don’t have a great feel yet for the trade-offs of the Lyot-type vs. three 4-quadrant phase-mask (4QPM) coronagraphs.
%% Replicating the full Ferruit et al. GTO #1219 proposal, which includes NIRSpec MSA and IFU  observations as well, is 18.71hrs per object, pushing you to > ~400 hrs (!!) 

Some other key things to note:  
%%
The JWST GTO teams are already looking at $z>6.70$ quasars. 
However, %from what I can tell (see attached JWST_GTO_VHzQ.notes)
only quasar J1342+0928 at $z=7.54$ is currently being observed by MIRI. 
%%
Other teams and collaborations will also be studying the very high-redshifts quasars. 
A key point here is not to directly compete with those observations, but moreover, complement them.
As such, our team has a {\it a zero  proprietary period} making the data immediately accessible from
a webpages (e.g. github.com/d80b2t/JWST\_Cycle1)
%%
The GTO and ERS programs already have the targets and instruments and modes 
that they are going to be using. One could then start to build-up on that arguing that 
you’ll never have the lambda >5um space-based data again any time again soon, 
and
Generating a sample for a large number (all) of the currnently known $z>6.7$ quasars is exactly 
what JWST was built for, and this will tremendously legacy value. 
%%
This could/would be suggested as a multi-cycle program (though not necessarily explicitly 
as that I don’t think this category is implemented yet). Using the Cycle 1+GTO+(ERS?) 
data as type of Pilot program, observing maybe $\sim$5-10 objects in total first, and letting 
that guide observations in future cycles.
